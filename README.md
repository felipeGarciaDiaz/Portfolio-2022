## Purpose Of This Project
This project was made to show my skills in creating and executing a design, and a website. Asside from the code,
This website was created with the planning and management of how a real company might work on a site. the website,
was first drafted up in figma and then I started coding each needed component to make the page work.

## Server
Currently this website is being hosted via http://felipedev.us/ using the amazing linode.com servers. This was also,
a fun experience as I got to work with SaaS applications, and used cloud hosting and linux to ensure the server is,
running optimally 24/7.

*Overall this was a very fun project, and I hope you enjoy it!*
